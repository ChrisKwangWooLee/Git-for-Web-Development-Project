Stretch Questions

1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    Block element take up the full width of the web page and CAN use height and width properties.
    Inline element take up just the amount of space needed to disply the content and CANNOT use height and width properties.

2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    If an element is positioned absolutely, it will ignore block elements and position itself relative to the parent container.

3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
    display: inline-block

4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    block: <p>, <div>, <h1>
    inline: <a>, <span>
    inline-block: <img>

5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?
    Box model is how we, as a web developer, could think of each element. Each element is composed of a content, surrounded by padding, border, and margin.
    Not entirely sure what's meant by "fix for the box model," but cross-browser compatability issue can be resolved with Eric Meyer's CSS reset.
